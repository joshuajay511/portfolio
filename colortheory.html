                    <h2>What is HSL</h2>
                    <p>People familiar with image editing programs might be more familiar with HSL than they realize. The main advantage of HSL is that it makes it easy to select a color quickly – otherwise, users would have to painstakingly adjust and tweak RGB sliders until they get the color just right.</p>
                    <h3>Hue</h3>
                    <p>In HSL, the Hue determines what color of the rainbow something is. It’s represented in 360 degrees, like a traditional color wheel. One of the main advantages of HSL over RGB color is that complementary colors are located across from one another, which makes the whole system very intuitive.</p>
                    <h3>Saturation</h3>
                    <p>The distance from the middle of the color wheel is called the ‘Saturation’, or how much of a given hue is present. Looking closely at the color wheel above, it is apparent that the color becomes brighter and more vivid as one travels from the center of the circle to the edge.</p>
                    <h3>Lightness</h3>
                    <p>The ‘Lightness’ of a color is a gradient between black and white, where the ‘bottom’ of the cylinder is a total black, and the ‘top’ of the cylinder is totally white.</p>

                    <h2>Easy Color Paletts</h2>
                    <p>While readability is a big benefit, the most significant advantage is how easy HSL makes picking colors. When working with HEX codes, it’s hard to adjust a color and have it be the same hue but with different saturation or lightness. However, this becomes trivial with HSL, and you can generate all the tints and shades of one hue you could ever desire in seconds.</p>

                    <p>These are colors commonly found in nature. Many earth tones originate from clay pigments like umbre, ochre and sienna.  They can be created by combining a pure hue with white, black, or gray. These are considered in the more broad sense a neutral color. They are influenced by the tones of trees, forest, seas and sky and are muted and flat to emulate natural colors.</p> <br>

                    <p>Fluorescence is a result of photoluminescence. Phosphorescent color emits light when excited by visible or ultraviolet light. In the physical world, this is created by neon tubing or ultraviolet reactant paint colors, but in the digital world we can get this same effect by applying very bright and highly saturated colors to our designs.</p>

                <p>Color theory is the collection of rules and guidelines which designers use to communicate with users through appealing color schemes in visual interfaces. To pick the best colors every time, designers use a color wheel and refer to extensive collected knowledge about human optical ability, psychology, culture and more.</p>
